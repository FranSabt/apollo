The Apollo Proyect

In the same spirit of self-learning tools the Odin-Project, the AP is focused in that one person  could learn music by themselves, especially in what refers to Musical Language (often called Music Theory) because this tends to be the most  difficult aspect of the learning of music that limits the possibilities that a person could do whit an instrument.
